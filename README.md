# UNILAG Concrete Lab ‚Äì Mix Intake Form

A free web application for the **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Concrete Laboratory, University of Lagos**.  

This app allows clients and researchers to submit details of their concrete mix proportions, automatically save the data to a Google Sheet, and download a PDF report with UNILAG‚Äôs letterhead and logo.  

If saving to Google Sheets fails (e.g., network or authentication issues), the app **still generates the PDF** and provides a **Retry Save** button to attempt saving again without retyping the form.
